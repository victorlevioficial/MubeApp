]" derived an Offset (Offset(535.0, 620.4)) that would not hit test on the specified widget.
Maybe the widget is actually off-screen, or another widget is obscuring it, or the widget cannot receive pointer events.
Indeed, Offset(535.0, 620.4) is outside the bounds of the root of the render tree, Size(800.0, 600.0).
The finder corresponds to this RenderBox: RenderParagraph#1c7c7 relayoutBoundary=up22 NEEDS-PAINT
The hit test result at that offset is: HitTestResult(HitTestEntry<HitTestTarget>#63de9(_ReusableRenderView#0f58e), HitTestEntry<HitTestTarget>#5c3b7(<AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding>))

To silence this warning, pass "warnIfMissed: false" to "tap()".
To make this warning fatal, set WidgetController.hitTestWarningShouldBeFatal to true.
