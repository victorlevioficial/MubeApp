  Cannot use the Ref of feedControllerProvider after it has been disposed. This typically happens if:
  - A provider rebuilt, but the previous "build" was still pending and is still performing operations.
    You should therefore either use `ref.onDispose` to cancel pending work, or
    check `ref.mounted` after async gaps or anything that could invalidate the provider.
  - You tried to use Ref inside `onDispose` or other life-cycles.
    This is not supported, as the provider is already being disposed.
